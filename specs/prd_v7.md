We want to create a sell covered call option mcp server tool.

The purpose types are "income", similar to that of sell put, and "减仓" (what's the word in English?), meaning sell off the position of the stock to the cash at a higher price than current market price plus the extra premium.

Let's MIRROR /Users/szou/Python/Playground/TradingAgentMCP/specs/prd_v6_ai_enhanced.md to generate a full prd for this sell covered call option mcp server tool.

write the full and enhanced prd to /Users/szou/Python/Playground/TradingAgentMCP/specs/prd_v7_ai_enhanced.md
